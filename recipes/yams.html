    <h2> Description</h2>

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 

            1 (29 ounce) can sweet potatoes, drained
            </li>
        <li> 

            ¼ cup butter, cut into pieces
            </li>
        <li> 

            ½ cup brown sugar
            </li>
        <li> 

            1 ½ cups miniature marshmallows
            </li>
    
    </ul>

    <p>Drain the syrup: To prevent your candied yams from becoming too runny, make sure to drain off any excess syrup. Once drained, transfer the yams to a medium-sized baking dish.
        Dice the butter: Cut the cold butter into small, even pieces and scatter them across the yams to ensure even distribution as it melts.
        Sprinkle with brown sugar: Pack the brown sugar tightly into a measuring cup, then transfer it to a bowl. Break up any clumps to make it easier to sprinkle evenly over the yams.
        Top with mini marshmallows: Depending on your preference, you might use more marshmallows than the recipe suggests to ensure they cover the yams well. Place them close together to create that signature golden, toasted marshmallow topping.
        Bake: Since the yams are already cooked, you’re essentially just heating them through and allowing the marshmallows to melt and turn golden brown on top. </p>
